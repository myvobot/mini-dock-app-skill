## Install

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/myvobot/mini_dock --skill mini-dock
```

Restart or reload the app after installing.

## Use

```text
Use $mini-dock to build a generic mini dock app.
```

```text
Use $mini-dock to create a BLE NUS control app for mini dock.
```

```text
Use $mini-dock to review my mini dock app structure and resource paths.
```

## Scope

This skill is device-focused and app-neutral. It covers mini dock app structure, LVGL UI, input handling, SDK peripherals, GPIO safety policy, BLE NUS patterns, and deployment guidance. It does not assume compatibility with any single companion app or protocol.
